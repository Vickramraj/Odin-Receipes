    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A melt in the mouth soft and spongy cheese balls in light and sweet mild cardamom flavored sugary syrup. Its a traditional and easy to make Bengali sweet that you can’t go wrong with.
        Rasgulla or popularly known as Rosogolla in local dialect, actually originated from Orissa and as with many other Indian sweet and dessert recipes, requires only three basic ingredients (milk, sugar and lemon juice) which are easily available in any kitchen all the time. In this step by step photo recipe of Rasgulla first chhena (aka paneer or Indian cottage cheese) is prepared from milk using lemon juice and then small balls prepared from it are cooked in sugar syrup to give it a sweet character.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter Full Cream Milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1½ cups Sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups Water</li>
            <li>2-3 Green Cardamom Pods, optional</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the milk to boil over medium flame. Mix lemon juice with 2 tablespoons water.</li>
            <li>When milk comes to rolling boil, add water-lemon juice mixture gradually and stir continuously using spatula. Solid milk portion and liquid whey portion will start to separate within minute or two. When it separates completely, turn off the flame. Spread a cheese-cloth (plain muslin cloth) over large strainer or colander and transfer over it and drain the whey. Rinse it in running water or pour 2-3 glasses of plain water over it to remove sourness (lemony taste).</li>      
            <li>Drain water and tie chhena in a muslin cloth. Squeeze it gently to drain the excess water and hang it for 30 minutes to get the right amount of moisture. Do not hang it for more than 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Untie the muslin cloth and transfer chhena to a plate.</li>
            <li>Crumble it with hand. It should be crumbly and little moist. If it is too dry, rasgulla will turn hard and if it is too soft, they will break while cooking and will not retain their shape after cooking.</li>
            <li>Knead it using hand until it all comes together like dough and it starts to release some fat. Your palm will turn little greasy; its an indication that it has started to release fat. Stop kneading after that.</li>
            <li>Make 13-15 small balls from kneaded paneer dough. The size of balls will increase to almost double after boiling in sugar syrup in next step so do not make very large balls.</li>
            <li>Heat 1½ cups sugar with 4-cups water and cardamom pods in a large broad vessel (having lid) like pressure cooker or saucepan over medium flame and make sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>When it comes to rolling boil, gently drop prepared balls in it.</li>
            <li>Cover it with a lid and let it cook over medium flame. If you are using pressure cooker, just put the lid over cooker, do not use whistle.</li>
            <li>After about 5-minutes, remove the lid and stir it gently with a spatula. Again, cover it with a lid and let it boil over medium flame for 7-8 minutes, stir it gently once in between. Remove lid and turn off the flame. You will notice that size of balls has increased to</li>
            <li>They will shrink a little after turning off the flame but it is normal. (If it shrinks too much then its an indication that something has gone wrong.) Transfer them to a large bowl and let them cool for 5-6 hours. Rasgulla are now ready for serving.</li>
